## Parts to Buy
* Expansion Plug – https://www.mcmaster.com/#expansion-test-plugs/=1b6mhxb
* 2.5" Schedule 40 PVC - https://www.mcmaster.com/#pvc-(schedule-40)-pipe/=1b6mj5j
* 2.5" PVC Cap – https://www.mcmaster.com/#pvc-caps/=1b6mjmo
* JB Weld (Epoxy) – https://www.mcmaster.com/#j-b-weld/=1b6mjyj
* Drill and appropriate drill bits for the sensor hole
* Styrofoam?

## Instructions
1) Make the PVC tube whatever length you need to fit the equipment.
2) The PVC Cap is drilled out and is then permanently mounted on the PVC.
3) Put the probe into the PVC cap and then use the epoxy to seal the gaps.
4) When the PVC cap is placed on the Schedule 40 PVC pipe, you can choose whether you want to use the epoxy to seal the end cap. It's probably not necessary, but it doesn't hurt and it's unlikely that you're going to be able to remove it anyway once the device has been in the water a while.
5) The expansion plug is the access port. The link takes you to the one that I think will work the best, but there are lots of options.

## Notes
* 2.5" PVC seems to be ideal based on the dimensions of the aduino. The downside is that this is a non-standard size, so we might have to do things like purchase from McMaster or plumbing shops (they are around). At least some of this stuff can be bought a Home Despot or Lowes, but McMaster is pretty great (and very fast).
* The Arduino is 2.1" in diameter. The get it fixed in there securely I think that gluing styrofoam inside the PVC tubing is the best bet. Cut out some rails for the Arduino and then glue the styrofoam in. I don't think this has to be fancy to work.
* There is no reason to believe the JB Weld will melt the heat shrink tubing.
* We are moving to a new case design, but this one will work
* You need to use silicone to ensure a tight seal, and should place dessicant in the case when deploying
